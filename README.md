# social-network-MERN
 Simple social network for developers like Github

NOTE: Project will not be working until you wont set you own MongoDB as a primary cuz mine is down. Just put your credentials in a default.json 
NOTE2: I'm fully aware that there's has a unprotected opened data in a configuration file. I'm intended not included this file in gitignore cuz after commit and pushing this repo I knew that db is gonna down.
